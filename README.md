**A Library for useful computational physics implementations**

This repository contains efficient and high throughput implementations, usually in Python and GPU optimized, for different computations, solvers and algorithms in physics. Mostly tailored towards computational electromagnetics but many of the implementations are designed for more general applicability to other domains.

**List of implementations**

**Magnetostatic Stray Field solver for 2d thin films**: FFT enhanced stray field computation at a specified observation plane at height h, for a 2d magnetic thin film. The method is built using PyTorch to be fully differentiable and incorporates GPU optimization.
